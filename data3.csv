We’ve taken some real questions from real people and partnered with providers to get the answers. How long does it take for breast cancer to grow? My doctor just examined my breasts a month ago (no lumps), and today I found a lump. Is it possible that breast cancer could have developed so quickly? Answer from the expert staff of breast cancer research at the Robert W. Franz Cancer Research Center at Providence Portland Medical Center: Like a lot of cancers, breast cancer grows by simple cell division. It begins as one malignant cell, which then divides and becomes two bad cells, which divide again and become four bad cells, and so on. Breast cancer has to divide 30 times before it can be felt. Up to the 28th cell division, neither you nor your doctor can detect it by hand.With most breast cancers, each division takes one to two months, so by the time you can feel a cancerous lump, the cancer has been in your body for two to five years. It can certainly seem like a lump appeared out of nowhere – especially if you or your doctor have recently examined your breasts and not felt anything suspicious – but in reality, the cancer has simply doubled that one last time necessary to be noticeable. By the time you can feel it, a breast tumor is usually a little more than one-half inch in size – about a third the size of a golf ball. It has also been in your body long enough to have had a chance to spread.This sounds scary, but what it really underscores is the importance of regular mammograms. These screening tests can usually detect breast cancer when it’s about one-quarter inch in size or smaller – a year or more before it would be detectable by hand. Mammograms also make possible the early diagnosis of some pre-cancerous conditions and early-stage cancers that appear as tiny calcifications (microcalcifications) on mammography, but aren’t detectable by physical examination.",breast cancer,

Do you know who’s at risk and what women can do to reduce their chances of developing the disease? Here are answers to common questions about breast cancer that can help all women in their quest to stay healthy. Is there an optimal time to perform a monthly breast self-exam? Yes. Young women should perform a breast self-exam seven to 10 days after their period starts. This is when breasts tend to be the least tender and lumpy. Women who are in menopause or older should perform a breast self-exam on the same day every month.",breast cancer,

And for the nearly 281,550 women who will be diagnosed with invasive breast cancer in 2021, that’s a welcome reassurance. During Breast Cancer Awareness Month, we’re shining a light on how the clinical trials at Providence can offer hope to women everywhere. “Research and clinical trials are constantly seeking out the next best thing in breast cancer care,” explains Alison K. Conlin, M.D., MPH, medical oncologist at Providence. “It has given us new ideas and treatment options, and it has helped us improve the individualized treatment women receive. Providence Cancer Institute plays an active role in bringing promising clinical trials to patients. In fact, we were one of the first sites internationally to open a clinical trial of the immunotherapy drug Atezolizumab, combined with a common chemotherapy for women with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer. After rigorous study, the drug was found to help women with stage 4, triple-negative breast cancer live longer and improve their quality of life.",breast cancer,
