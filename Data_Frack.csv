<p>Advances in breast cancer diagnosis and treatment are leading to better outcomes. And for the nearly&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.breastcancer.org/symptoms/understand_bc/statistics"">281,550 women</a>&nbsp;who will be diagnosed with invasive breast cancer in 2021, that&rsquo;s a welcome reassurance. During&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.cancer.org/latest-news/special-coverage/how-acs-fights-breast-cancer.html"">Breast Cancer Awareness Month</a>, we&rsquo;re shining a light on how the clinical trials at Providence can offer hope to women everywhere.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Research and clinical trials are constantly seeking out the next best thing in breast cancer care,&rdquo; explains&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.providence.org/doctors/profile/159571-alison-k-conlin"">Alison K. Conlin</a>, M.D., MPH, medical oncologist at Providence. &ldquo;It has given us new ideas and treatment options, and it has helped us improve the individualized treatment women receive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Providence Cancer Institute plays an active role in bringing promising clinical trials to patients. In fact, we were one of the first sites internationally to open a clinical trial of the immunotherapy drug&nbsp;<a href=""https://providencefoundations.org/providence-clinical-trials-lead-to-approval-of-new-treatment-for-aggressive-breast-cancer/"">Atezolizumab</a>, combined with a common chemotherapy for women with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer. After rigorous study, the drug was found to help women with stage 4, triple-negative breast cancer live longer and improve their quality of life.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>But it&rsquo;s not just the availability of these studies at Providence that leads to better understanding and treatment of breast cancer. It&rsquo;s also the women and men willing to participate in clinical trials and research. One of those women is&nbsp;<a href=""https://blog.providence.org/cancer/breast-cancer-immunotherapy-breakthrough"">Eva Joseph</a>, a participant in the Atezolizumab study. In 2012, Eva learned her breast cancer had spread to her lungs and bones. Four years after participating in the Atezolizumab study, she says she is &ldquo;basically healthy.&rdquo; The survival rate for her diagnosis is typically just two years.&nbsp;</p>

<p><iframe allow=""accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"" allowfullscreen="""" frameborder=""0"" height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/j6-8WPgk4Jk"" width=""560""></iframe></p>

<p>&ldquo;This, to me, is amazing,&rdquo; Eva says. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a blessing that I am able to receive treatment when so many others before me couldn&rsquo;t. It just wasn&rsquo;t there for them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eva has single-handedly been able to change the lives of so many women after her,&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;says Dr.&nbsp;&nbsp;Conlin. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the power of a clinical trial.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>Better understanding, better treatment</h2>

<p>It was research that also led to understanding the different subtypes of breast cancer. Providers, patients and their loved ones know that not all breast cancers are the same. Scientists were able to identify the&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.cancer.gov/types/breast/research"">three main subtypes</a>, which include:&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>Hormone receptor (HR) positive</li>
	<li>Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) positive</li>
	<li>Triple-negative breast cancer</li>
</ul>

<p>It&rsquo;s the ever-expanding field of knowledge on these different types of cancers and how they respond to treatments that are leading to better outcomes for many women.&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Care has become so incredibly individualized. It&rsquo;s science that has helped make things better and improve what we know and can offer women.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&ldquo;Care has become so incredibly individualized,&rdquo; explains Dr. Conlin. &ldquo;We know who may benefit the most from chemo, who may benefit most from surgery. That understanding comes from clinical trials. It&rsquo;s science that has helped make things better and improve what we know and can offer women.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dr. Conlin and colleagues are also investigating therapies that help improve survival for patients with HER2+ breast cancer. One study is researching if a new combination of therapies can&nbsp;<a href=""https://oregon.providence.org/clinical-trials/oregon-oncology-breast/randomized-double-blind-phase-3-study-of-tucatinib-or-placebo-in-combination-with-ado-trastuzumab-e/"">increase survival for women with HER2+</a>&nbsp;breast cancer that has metastasized or cannot be removed completely with surgery.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Another study, also researching&nbsp;<a href=""https://oregon.providence.org/clinical-trials/oregon-oncology-breast/neoadjuvant-her2-targeted-therapy-and-immunotherapy-with-pembrolizumab-neohip/"">therapy options for HER2+ breast cancer</a>, is evaluating the efficacy and safety of immunotherapy for certain patients.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Finding hope in research</h2>

<p>Dr. Conlin is quick to remind patients that a clinical trial is not a last resort.&nbsp;<br />
</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are so many different types of research, from whether exercise during chemotherapy can help reduce fatigue to how well cancer survivors sleep,&rdquo; she says.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your provider should be able to guide you to research that&rsquo;s right for you and discuss the pros and cons of participating in the study,&rdquo; she finishes.</p>

<p><strong>Diabetes Awareness Month brings awareness to the disease and educates those at risk.</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>What is the difference between Type 1 and 2?</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Gestational diabetes can increase risk during pregnancy.</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Hear from a recording artist about his complications from diabetes.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>The United States is currently facing a growing epidemic of diabetes. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 34.2 million American adults have diabetes, however, 1 in 5 of those people don&rsquo;t even know it. The seventh leading cause of death in the U.S., diabetes is the number one cause of kidney failure, lower limb amputations and adult blindness.</p>

<p>In preparation for&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.diabetes.org/community/american-diabetes-month"">Diabetes Awareness Month</a>&nbsp;in November, healthcare leaders at Providence are focused on educating the community about this chronic condition and promoting screenings.</p>

<p><strong>The difference between Type 1 and 2 diabetes</strong></p>

<p>Mona Garcia, RN, certified diabetic educator, participated in #TalkToADoc, a series of podcasts about diabetes and how the disease affects the body. In &ldquo;<a href=""https://youtu.be/iZ-ZbulycNs"">Diabetes Type 1 &amp; 2</a>,&rdquo; Garcia discusses the difference between the two conditions, the risk factors and the importance of screenings. Key takeaways include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Type 1 diabetes is usually an autoimmune disorder. The only treatment available is insulin.</li>
	<li>Type 2 diabetes often is the result of genetic components as well as lifestyle choices. It can appear at any age, and usually can be managed with medication.</li>
	<li>Diabetes increases the risk of heart disease, kidney and nerve damage, and eye problems.</li>
	<li>Nutrition plays a key role in preventing diabetes and/or managing the disease.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Gestational diabetes</strong></p>

<p>In the second #TalkToADoc podcast, &ldquo;<a href=""https://youtu.be/gdL6S0UokSs"">Gestational Diabetes</a>,&rdquo; Garcia discusses what expectant moms should know about this condition, which affects 2% to 10% of pregnancies. It increases the risk for:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Preterm labor</li>
	<li>Infections</li>
	<li>Preeclampsia&nbsp;</li>
	<li>High blood pressure</li>
	<li>C-section delivery</li>

<p><strong>Why diabetes education is so important</strong></p>

<p>In 2016, recording artist 2Mex nearly died from diabetes. Although he lost a leg below the knee due to complications, 2Mex was determined to get back to making music and hosting the 2Mex Hologram radio show. Garcia sat down with 2Mex to talk about his disease in the video</p>

<p></p><address>Alex Smith | NPR</address><p>For decades, people struggling with illnesses of all kinds have sought help in online support groups, and during 2020, such groups have been in high demand for COVID-19 patients, who often must recover in isolation.</p>
<p>But the fear and uncertainty regarding the coronavirus have made online groups targets for the spread of false information. And to help fellow patients, some of these groups are making a mission of stamping out misinformation.</p>
<p>Shortly after Matthew Long-Middleton got sick on March 12, he joined a COVID-19 support group run by an organization called Body Politic on the messaging platform Slack.</p>
<p>""I had no idea where this road leads, and so I was looking for support and other theories and some places where people were going through a similar thing, including the uncertainty, and also the thing of like, we have to figure this out for ourselves,"" says Long-Middleton, 36, an avid cyclist who lives in Kansas City, Missouri. His illness started with chest discomfort, then muscle weakness, high fever, loss of appetite and digestive problems. </p>
<p>But with the support came misinformation. Group members reported taking massive amounts of vitamins &mdash; including Vitamin D which can be harmful in excess &mdash; or trying other home remedies not backed by science. </p>
<p>Experts warn that such false or unverified information spread on online support groups can not only mislead patients, but also potentially undermine trust in science and medicine in general. </p>
<p>""Even if we're not actively seeking information, we encounter these kinds of messages on social media, and because of this repeated exposure, there's more likelihood that it's going to seep into our thinking and perhaps even change the way that we view certain issues, even if there's no real merit or credibility,"" says <a href=""https://camd.northeastern.edu/faculty/elizabeth-glowacki/"">Elizabeth Glowacki, </a>a health communication researcher at Northeastern University. </p>
<p>In an effort to help fellow COVID-19 sufferers, some patients, like Vanessa Cruz, spend most of their days fact checking their online support groups. </p>
<p>""It's really become like a second family to me and being able to help everybody is a positive thing that comes out of all this negativity we're experiencing right now,"" Cruz says. </p>
<p>Cruz, a 43-year-old mother of two, moderates the Facebook COVID-19 support group ""have it/had it"" from her home in the Chicago suburbs. She's also a ""long-hauler,"" and has been dealing with COVID-19 symptoms, including fatigue, fever and confusion since March.</p>
<p>The worldwide group has more than 30,000 members and has recently been buzzing with reports from India about treating COVID-19 with a common tapeworm medication (it's <a href=""https://www.fda.gov/animal-veterinary/product-safety-information/faq-covid-19-and-ivermectin-intended-animals"">not FDA-approved </a>and there's little evidence it works) &mdash; as well as speculation about President Trump's recent diagnosis. </p>
<p>Other troubling posts include people pushing hydroxychloroquine, which has not been proven to be effective in treating COVID-19, and sharing the viral video ""America's Frontline Doctors"" which promotes other unproven treatments and spreads conspiracy theories.</p>
<p>Cruz says supporting fellow patients can be a tricky balance of getting the facts right, but also giving people who are scared the chance to be heard. </p>
<p>""It's like you really don't know what to question, what to ask for, how to reach for help,"" Cruz says. ""Instead of doing that, they just, they write up their story, basically, and they share it with everybody."" </p>
<p>To keep the group evidence-based, it has built up a 17-person fact checking team, which includes two nurses and a biologist, that reviews every post that goes up.  </p>
<p>However, many online COVID-19 groups don't have the resources or strategy to address misinformation. </p>
<p>Mel Montano, a 32-year-old writing instructor who lives in New York and has also felt sick since March, says she left a large Facebook support group because she was frustrated by the conspiracy theories that filled its posts. </p>
<p>""All of these conflicting theories completely took away from the focal point of it,"" Montano explains. ""It was a mess. It was [like] being on one of those conspiracy theory pages or channels, and it was just not for me.""</p>
<p>Montano is now a moderator of the Body Politic group on Slack. </p>
<p>Facebook and Twitter have made changes in their approaches toward COVID-19 misinformation, including additional fact checking, removing posts that contain falsehoods and removing users or groups that spread them.  </p>
<p>However, critics say more changes are needed. </p>
<p>Fadi Quran, campaign director of Avaaz, a human rights group that focuses on disinformation campaigns, says Facebook needs to revise the way it prioritizes content.</p>
<p>""Facebook's algorithm prefers misinformation, prefers the sensational stuff that's going to get clicks and likes and make people angry,"" Quran says. ""And so the misinformation actors, because of Facebook, will always have the upper hand.""</p>
<p>A study by Avaaz showed that misinformation and disinformation had been viewed on Facebook four times as often as information from official health groups, like the World Health Organization. </p>
<p>Facebook did not respond to inquiries for this story. </p>
<p>COVID-19 patient Matthew Long-Middleton thinks the problem goes deeper than getting the data right. He says a lot of bad information is spread because patients so badly want to find ways to feel better. </p>
<p>After nearly six months of symptoms, Long-Middleton says he's returned to better health in the past month, though he continues to check in on fellow support group members who are still struggling. </p>
<p>He never tried  risky treatments discussed in the group himself, but he understands why someone might.</p>
<p>""You want to find hope, but you don't want the hope to lead you down a path that hurts you,"" he says. </p>

<p></p><address>Joe Palca | NPR</address><p>Historically, tobacco plants are responsible for their share of illness and death. Now they may help control the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>Two biotech companies are using the tobacco plant, <a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18616398/""><em>Nicotiana benthamiana</em></a>, as bio-factories to produce a key protein from the coronavirus that can be used in a vaccine.</p>
<p>""There's obvious irony there,"" says <a href=""https://rjrt.com/transforming-tobacco/leadership/"">James Figlar</a>, executive vice president for research and development for R.J. Reynolds Tobacco. Reynolds owns <a href=""https://kentuckybioprocessing.com/"">Kentucky BioProcessing</a>, one of the companies working on a COVID-19 vaccine from plants.</p>
<p>""If you wanted to be cynical about it, you could,"" he says. ""But we tend to think of it as like at the end of the day, the tobacco plant in and of itself is still just a plant.""</p>
<p>Vaccines work by tricking people's immune system into believing it's been exposed to a virus so it can fight the virus off, if the real thing should ever turn up.</p>
<p>There are various ways to do that. One is to introduce something that looks like a virus to the immune system, but isn't infectious. That's the approach Kentucky Bioprocessing is using.</p>
<p>To make its vaccine, the company starts with tobacco seeds that they plant in a greenhouse. When the plants are approximately 25 days old, they're dipped into a solution containing agrobacteria. These are microorganisms that infect plants. In this case, they've been modified to contain instructions for making a protein from the coronavirus. The plants take up those instructions.</p>
<p>Seven days after being exposed to the agrobacteria, ""we harvest the plant, go through an extraction and purification process, and at the end of the cycle, we have 99.9 percent pure protein, says company president <a href=""https://kentuckybioprocessing.com/who-we-are/"">Hugh Haydon.</a></p>
<p>A separate set of plants produces a tiny particle for packaging the viral protein.</p>
<p>""Once each of those components has been manufactured and purified separately, we chemically attach them to each other,"" Haydon says.</p>
<p>The result is something that can be injected into a human as a vaccine &mdash; and will prompt an immune response that should, in theory, protect someone from dying from COVID-19.</p>
<p>""To all intents and purposes, it looks like a virus,"" says Bruce Clark, CEO of <a href=""https://www.medicago.com/en/"">Medicago</a>, a Canadian biotech company that's also using tobacco plants to make a vaccine.</p>
<p>""So when it presents to the body, it looks and generates a response like a virus, but it has no genetic material inside,"" so it can't actually infect someone, Clark says.</p>
<p>Medicago has already begun testing its vaccine candidate in humans. Results from the initial studies are expected soon.</p>
<p>Kentucky Bioprocessing's COVID-19 vaccine won't be ready for initial testing in humans for several weeks yet. Even if the vaccine isn't one of the first to be approved, it may have advantages over some of the other vaccines. For example, it can be stored at normal refrigeration temperatures, and may even be stable at room temperature, making it easier to distribute.</p>
<p>Besides, says Haydon, ""There will be other public health challenges. And the more that we can learn as a company, the better prepared we are for what comes next.""</p>
<p>Plant biologist Kathleen Hefferon agrees plants could play an important role in the future of medicine.</p>
<p>""There are lots of examples of a plant made versions of therapeutic proteins, and so this is just another place where I think plants can make their mark.""</p>

<p></p><address>Selena Simmons-Duffin and Pien Huang | NPR</address><p>Even the most effective, safest coronavirus vaccine won't work to curb the spread of the virus unless a large number of people get immunized. And getting a vaccine from the manufacturers all the way into people's arms requires complex logistics &mdash; and will take many months. </p>
<p>Now, public health officers across the country are rushing to finish up the first draft of plans for how to distribute a coronavirus vaccine if and when it is authorized, and they're grappling with a host of unknowns as they try to design a system for getting the vaccine out to everyone who wants it.</p>
<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention gave state immunization managers <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/imz-managers/downloads/COVID-19-Vaccination-Program-Interim_Playbook.pdf"">only 30 days</a> to draft a comprehensive COVID-19 vaccine distribution plan &mdash; and Friday is the day those plans are due.</p>
<p>The timing of vaccine research and planning is politically fraught, with the presidential election a few weeks away. When CDC announced the October deadline <a href=""https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/09/04/909655696/states-prepare-for-potential-fall-vaccine-distribution-under-pressure-from-cdc"">last month</a>, critics worried that <a href=""https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/09/04/909655696/states-prepare-for-potential-fall-vaccine-distribution-under-pressure-from-cdc"">political pressure was tainting the process</a>, since President Trump has repeatedly promised a vaccine <a href=""https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/09/16/913560563/cdc-director-says-covid-vaccine-likely-wont-be-widely-available-until-next-year"">will be ready soon</a>. </p>
<p>""If you listen to the White House, [vaccine distribution] could be just a matter of weeks away,"" New York Governor Andrew Cuomo told reporters on Thursday. He and Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson <a href=""https://www.governor.ny.gov/sites/governor.ny.gov/files/atoms/files/NGA_Vaccine_Letter_10.14.20_V4.pdf"">sent a letter</a> to President Trump on behalf of the National Governors Association, asking for a meeting to talk through the many unanswered questions about the process. </p>
<p>""We need to know: What is the plan? What does the federal government do, what do you expect the states to do? When does it start? Who funds it?"" Cuomo said. ""Let's figure it out now, because this virus has been ahead of us every step of the way &mdash; it's about time this country catches up.""</p>
<p><strong>Planning fast, with changing expectations</strong></p>
<p>For dozens of public health officials across the country, the process over the past month has been like ""herding a lot of cats,"" says <a href=""https://www.immunizationmanagers.org/page/Staff"">Claire Hannan</a>, director of the Association of Immunization Managers. ""It's really cramming three to six months worth of strategic discussions [...] into 30 days,"" she says. </p>
<p>States need to lay the groundwork for distribution now, says <a href=""https://www.astho.org/Blogs/BlogDetails.aspx?id=17557&amp;blogid=4396"">James Blumenstock</a>, vice president for pandemic response and recovery for the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials. That means deciding who's in charge of responsibilities such as ordering supplies, signing up vaccine providers, training staff, running mass vaccination clinics and outreach campaigns, he explains. They'll also need a data management system to track who received an initial vaccine dose, and to remind them to come back for their second dose.</p>
<p>""We have been working feverishly over the past few weeks,"" says Decrecia Limbrick, assistant director of the Department of Health in Houston, which is one of several large cities that receives funding directly from CDC. ""I think we're ready to submit a plan &mdash; a 'Version One' of a plan.""</p>
<p>Then there are conflicting messages from the Trump administration. ""Originally there had been talk about hurrying up and getting your plan done because the vaccine will be ready before the election,"" says Kris Ehresmann, director of infectious disease for Minnesota's Department of Health. When the Food and Drug Administration recently said that vaccine trials <a href=""https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/10/06/920942575/fda-releases-long-awaited-covid-19-vaccine-guidance"">must allow two months</a> after the last experimental dose is administered, that guidance  ""changes the timeline"" again.</p>
<p>""It's pretty much like being in a continuous earthquake,"" she adds. ""The ground is constantly moving.""</p>
<p><strong>Overcoming logistical hurdles</strong></p>
<p>Nobody knows which vaccine will be authorized first, when that will happen, which populations it will be authorized for, and how many initial doses will be available.</p>
<p>Adding to this uncertainty is the likelihood that the first coronavirus vaccines will be extremely challenging to handle. The <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/imz-managers/downloads/COVID-19-Vaccination-Program-Interim_Playbook.pdf"">CDC playbook</a> notes the vaccines will likely require cold chain storage &mdash; possibly ""ultra-cold"" storage, which is colder than Antarctica &mdash; must be given in two doses a certain number of days apart, and could have a minimum order of 1,000 doses. </p>
<p>""For routine vaccines, [providers] will order 10 doses at the time or 20 doses at a time,"" explains Michigan Department of Health and Human Services immunization director Bob Swanson. ""It makes it more difficult to think about &mdash; how are we going to use a thousand doses for at risk populations across a rural county?""</p>
<p>Initially, the focus will be on the priority groups who will be first in line to get immunized. The specifics of who that will be are <a href=""https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/09/22/915662174/with-limited-covid-19-vaccine-doses-who-would-get-it-first"">still getting worked out</a> by a CDC advisory committee, although frontline health workers will almost certainly be at the top of the list. There are also concerns about distributing the vaccine equitably to communities that, for instance, speak different languages or are difficult to reach, especially at first when doses are limited. </p>
<p>As immunization managers look ahead to the coming year, different places around the country face a range of challenges. </p>
<p>Then there are seasonal issues. During a North Dakota winter, freezing temperatures and snowfall make outdoor drive-through clinics untenable, says Molly Howell, North Dakota's immunization program manager, so they're considering using warehouses or sporting venues for mass vaccination campaigns, so that people can gather indoors while maintaining physical distance. ""Those are some of the ways that we're trying to be creative about vaccinating people safely during the pandemic,"" she says. </p>
<p>In Houston, officials are thinking ahead to the complications of the hot and humid summer. ""If we get those hot days, we want to obviously ensure that we maintain the integrity of the vaccine,"" says Limbrick of the Houston Department of Health, and they have to think about taking care of the medical staff who have to administer the vaccine in those conditions.</p>
<p>""After [health officials] push that button on Friday afternoon, on Saturday morning, they're going to continue to work on their planning efforts going forward over the days and weeks and months ahead,"" says Blumenstock of ASTHO. And when the first vaccine is authorized, ""it's going to be close to a year-long effort,"" he says, to immunize everyone across the country who wants to be vaccinated.</p>
<p><strong>Finding the money to execute plans</strong></p>
<p>CDC director Robert Redfield <a href=""https://www.c-span.org/video/?475764-1/coronavirus-vaccine-widely-late-2021-cdc-director"">told Congress last month</a> that states are going to need around $6 billion dollars to distribute vaccines. </p>
<p>""This is going to take substantial resources,"" Redfield told lawmakers. ""The time is now for us to be able to get those resources out to the state[s].""</p>
<p>On Thursday, ASTHO and the Association of Immunization Managers wrote a letter <a href=""https://astho.org/Federal-Government-Relations/Correspondence/ASTHO-AIM-Funds-for-Vaccination-Distribution-Letter/"">formally requested $8.4 billion</a> from Congress for these efforts. </p>
<p>The letter notes that so far CDC has <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/downloads/php/funding-update.pdf"">distributed $200 million</a> to states, territories, and a few large cities to fund the vaccine planning process &mdash; but describes this sum as ""merely a down payment."" And with the election looming, the chances of a new COVID-19 relief bill getting through the legislature anytime soon are dim.</p>
<p>""The funding I don't have control over, but I do have control over how we're going to get vaccines out when they're available,"" says Swanson. ""And I will tell you, public health is strong, and public health works hard, and immunizations are public health's bread and butter.""</p>
<p>Michigan has received $5.9 million so far, and Swanson says that money has gone to getting the state's immunization registry up to speed, and to local health departments for staffing.</p>
<p>The lack of clarity about funding troubles Dr. Kelly Moore, associate director of immunization education at the Immunization Action Coalition and the former director of Tennessee's immunization program. </p>
<p>States need additional funds to be able to carry out the plans they're submitting to CDC, she says. ""They need to be able to invest in manpower, in I.T. systems and in the people to use them,"" she explains, adding that those who are brought in to run the vaccination campaigns from other parts of the health department like STD clinics and family planning, will also need to be backfilled. </p>
<p>""A lot of things need to be paid for with these billions of dollars,"" she says. ""Even the best laid plans can't be executed if you don't have the resources to do so.""  </p> Copyright 2020 NPR.

<p></p><address>Selena Simmons-Duffin | NPR</address><p>The Trump administration announced a new partnership with two major national pharmacy chains to facilitate the distribution of a future coronavirus vaccine to nursing homes on Friday.</p>
<p>""Today, I'm thrilled to announce that we have just finalized a partnership with CVS and Walgreens,"" President Trump told a group in Fort Myers, Fla., at an event centered on seniors. He said the plan was for the pharmacies to ""deliver the vaccine directly to nursing homes at no cost to our seniors.""</p>
<p>The Pharmacy Partnership for Long Term Care Program is part of the Trump administration's Operation Warp Speed effort. No coronavirus vaccines have yet been authorized by the government, though several vaccine candidates are in the final stages of clinical trials.</p>
<p>""Early in the COVID-19 vaccination program, there may be a limited supply of vaccine and our planning efforts need to focus on those at highest risk for developing severe illness from COVID-19,"" Dr. Jay Butler, deputy director for infectious diseases at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told reporters on a press call. </p>
<p>That includes people older than 65, who are <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/older-adults.html"">much more likely to get severely ill and die</a> from the coronavirus than other age groups. The details of which would be the <a href=""https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/09/22/915662174/with-limited-covid-19-vaccine-doses-who-would-get-it-first"">first groups to get a vaccine</a> once one is authorized is still in flux, but seniors would likely be among the first to be eligible.</p>
<p>The pharmacy program ""provides end-to-end management of the COVID-19 vaccination process,"" Butler explained. That includes scheduling on site clinic dates with each facility, ordering supplies like syringes, and ensuring cold-chain management of the vaccine. Once the vaccine is on site, pharmacy staff will administer it to residents and staff and report it to the required public health department.</p>
<p>The program will be free for facilities, but optional. ""This is voluntary. They have to opt-in,"" Paul Mango, deputy chief of staff for policy at the Department of Health and Human Services told reporters. ""This will be something that will be available to every nursing home and senior living facility in the country.""</p>
<p>""This is really significant,"" Claire Hannan, Executive Director of the Association of Immunization Managers wrote to NPR. ""We've never really had coordinated partnership between pharmacies and public health across all states.""</p>
<p>Friday was the deadline for <a href=""https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/10/16/924247360/facing-many-unknowns-states-rush-to-plan-distribution-of-covid-19-vaccines"">states to deliver a vaccine distribution plan</a> to CDC, which will be evaluating the plans and providing feedback over the next two weeks, according to federal health officials.</p>
<p>One of the leading vaccine candidates, <a href=""https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/10/16/924502362/pfizer-covid-19-vaccine-wont-be-ready-by-election-day"">made by Pfizer</a>, requires ultra-cold storage, which ""could pose a major challenge to getting nursing home and long term care residents vaccinated,"" explains Hannan, ""so the value of this partnership can't be understated.""</p>
<p>That aspect of the program stood out to <a href=""https://www.vumc.org/health-policy/person/stacie-b-dusetzina-phd"">Stacie Dusetzina</a>, professor of health policy at Vanderbilt as well.</p>
<p>""Cold storage and the cold chain management has been a huge sticking point &mdash; how do you get [vaccine] to everyone who needs it and maintain these super cold temperatures?"" she says. If CVS and Walgreens are going to be managing that challenge, she says, ""that seems like a really big, positive thing.""</p>
<p>A federal government partnership early in the pandemic with retail pharmacies to provide COVID-19 testing ended up <a href=""https://www.npr.org/2020/06/01/865510819/little-progress-made-in-trumps-plan-for-private-retailers-to-test-for-coronaviru"">yielding much less testing</a> than promised.  </p> Copyright 2020 NPR.

<p></p><address>Rob Stein | NPR</address><p>People are getting the results of coronavirus tests in the U.S. faster than they were in the spring, but testing still takes far too long to help effective disease control measures such as contact tracing and quarantining, according to the results of a large national survey. </p>
<p>The <a href=""http://www.kateto.net/covid19/COVID19%20CONSORTIUM%20REPORT%2017%20TEST%20OCT%202020.pdf"">survey, </a>which is conducted monthly by a consortium of researchers from Northeastern, Northwestern, Harvard and Rutgers universities, also finds that Hispanics and African-Americans are waiting about a day longer than whites on average, underscoring yet another way the pandemic is hitting minorities harder.</p>
<p>The researchers also found that a disturbingly high proportion of those testing positive &mdash; almost half &mdash; are never contacted by a health worker to determine who they may have infected, a crucial step for preventing outbreaks.</p>
<p>""That is how you limit the spread of the disease and limit the number of people who have to socially isolate and avoid lockdowns,"" says Dr. <a href=""https://web.northeastern.edu/nulab/"">David Lazer of Northeastern University</a>, who led the team conducting the survey. ""The good news is there has been some improvement. The bad news is everything is still taking far too long.""</p>
<p>The researchers surveyed 52,329 people in all 50 states and the District of Columbia in July, August and September as part of a series of ongoing surveys the team has been conducting since April.</p>
<p>Of those surveyed, 12,911 got a coronavirus test, including 8,843 whose sample was collected with a nasal swab.</p>
<p>Among that group, the average wait time for results was 2.7 days in September, down from four days in April,<a href=""http://bit.ly/covid-report-17""> the researchers found</a>. In addition, the proportion of people getting their results back within 24 hours increased from 23% to 37%.</p>
<p>While that's an improvement, the turnaround time is still ""too slow in most cases to support a successful strategy of contact tracing,"" and most people are still waiting far too long, the researchers wrote.</p>
<p>""Despite decreased average wait times, a substantial proportion of Americans still endure long waits,"" they added.</p>
<p>They noted that in September, 42% of those tested had to wait at least three days before getting their results.</p>
<p>The average black respondent waited 4.4 days to receive results and the average Hispanic respondent waited 4.1 days. In comparison, white and Asian American respondents respectively waited an average of 3.5 and 3.6 days, the researchers found.</p>
<p>""We know that African-Americans and Hispanics are underserved medically,"" Lazer says. ""This is reflective of that larger reality. It's terrible.""</p>
<p>To keep outbreaks from occurring, people who are infected need to be contacted quickly, ideally within 24-36 hours to make sure they don't infect other people and find out who they may have come into contact with so those people can be told to quarantine and get tested.</p>
<p>In fact, only 56% of those who tested positive were contacted by a health worker to get contact tracing information, the researchers found.</p>
<p>White respondents and black respondents are roughly equally likely to report contact tracing &mdash; 61% and 56% respectively.</p>
<p>""Delivering results is just one part of the testing process,"" the researchers note. ""Many face difficulties accessing tests in the first place.""</p>
<p>It's not just delays in test results that are styming public health efforts. Many respondents report obstacles in getting tested to start with. Thirty-five percent of people in the August and September surveys had to wait at least three days between deciding to get a test and actually getting the test, the researchers found.</p>
<p>The average person who got tested in the August and September surveys was tested within 2.5 days and waited 3.7 days for the results of the test. That means it took a total of 6.2 days between deciding on a test and receiving results, the researchers wrote.</p>
<p>""So even with the improvement in results, people are waiting about week. And by that point much of the harm that could occur in spreading through that person's social network has already occurred,"" Lazer says. ""What you want to do is cut that to within 24 hours to 36 hours.""</p>
<p>The reasons people have trouble getting tested varied. One-third of people did not know how or where to get a test, 23% said the testing site was too far away, and 14% said the test was too expensive.</p>
<p>The delays between deciding to get a test and getting final results were worst for Black respondents.  The average white person surveyed waited 5.7 days for their results after seeking a test. The average Asian-American, Hispanic, or Black respondent waited 6.1, 6.9, and 7.4 days respectively.  </p> Copyright 2020 NPR.

<p></p><address>Will Stone | NPR</address><p>With coronavirus outbreaks picking up speed in dozens of states, the U.S. is now climbing steadily toward a new peak in cases that may soon rival the summer surge &mdash; when the country hit more than 60,000 infections on average a day for weeks in a row.</p>
<p>On Friday, U.S. cases surged higher than they had since late July, hitting nearly 70,000 in one day. The seven-day daily average is now more than 55,000 cases a day. New cases have gone up by nearly 30% from two weeks ago. </p>
<p>Last week, 17 states &mdash; primarily in the Midwest and Great Plains &mdash; posted new daily records, according to the <a href=""https://covidtracking.com/blog/weekly-update-oct-15"">COVID Tracking Project</a>. </p>
<p>Hospitalizations also increased in more than 40 states, with the numbers of people <a href=""https://covidtracking.com/data/charts/us-currently-hospitalized"">currently hospitalized reaching more than 36,000,</a> which is more than half the highs recorded during the spring and summer surges. </p>
<p>Unlike during the summer, when a handful of larger states drove up the numbers, the current growth is diffused across many states.</p>
<p>""It's just these roving hot spots in a country that's big, and different areas are on different clocks,"" says <a href=""https://www.centerforhealthsecurity.org/our-people/adalja/"">Dr. Amesh Adalja</a>, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security. </p>
<p>The summer may have acted as a kind of buffer, he says, for the middle of the country, keeping the virus at lower levels in the community because people spent more time outside. </p>
<p>But Adalja says more people congregating indoors, including students returning to schools and college campuses, and general fatigue around pandemic precautions are all likely propelling this latest growth in cases. </p>
<p>""There may be places that were not hit hard early on where the virus finds it very hospitable because people are complacent,"" Adalja says.</p>
<p><strong>Which states are driving the surge?  </strong></p>
<p>The outbreaks raging in the Midwest play a major role in the rising numbers, with 43% growth in new infections over the past two weeks. </p>
<p>That region (defined as 12 states by the U.S. census) accounted for more than a third of all new cases in the U.S. over the past week, according to NPR's analysis of<a href=""https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#cases_casesinlast7days""> CDC data</a>. </p>
<p>Illinois and Wisconsin each added nearly 20,000 new cases in the past seven days, rivaling much larger states like California. Hospitalizations more than doubled in the past two weeks in Wisconsin, and the state stood up <a href=""https://www.wpr.org/covid-19-field-hospital-wisconsin-state-fair-park-opens-wednesday"">a field hospital </a>to make room for the growing number of patients. </p>
<p>While the overall numbers in North and South Dakota are lower than those of neighboring states, their rate of new infections per capita continues to eclipse all other states &mdash; and even what Arizona recorded during its devastating summer surge. </p>
<p>""We are caught in the middle of a COVID storm,"" said North Dakota's Republican Gov. Doug Burgum at a press event this week as he displayed a map with alarming positivity rates across the region, from Iowa to Idaho to Kansas.</p>
<p>The outbreak has increasingly fanned out to Western states, too.</p>
<p>Montana, Wyoming and Utah have high per capita rates of new infections on par with the Midwest, and even states that have successfully kept the virus in check for months are now seeing a spike. </p>
<p>In New Mexico, daily new infections more than doubled over the past two weeks and are now at the <a href=""https://cvprovider.nmhealth.org/public-dashboard.html"">highest levels</a> since the pandemic began. </p>
<p>The South, which includes Florida and Texas, accounts for close to 40% of total cases in the past week, with cases rising quickly in some states like Tennessee and Mississippi. While the Northeast has a much smaller share of cases compared to other regions, the average case count doubled over <a href=""https://covidtracking.com/blog/weekly-update-oct-15"">the past month</a>. </p>
<p><strong>Will more deaths soon follow?</strong></p>
<p>The pandemic was predicted to gain traction in the fall, a time when respiratory viruses typically peak as people spend more time indoors. But the steep rise has come even sooner than some public health experts anticipated. </p>
<p><em>""</em>It's happening at a rate that is even faster than I might have expected,"" says <a href=""https://www.baylor.edu/biology/index.php?id=960757"">Dr. Peter Hotez</a>, dean for the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine. ""I predict then we'll soon start seeing the number of deaths go up."" </p>
<p>Along with the arrival of cooler temperatures in Northern states, Hotez points out that some of those states have <a href=""https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/issue-brief/state-data-and-policy-actions-to-address-coronavirus/"">resisted mandates</a> requiring face masks and social distancing. </p>
<p>Some of the growth in cases is fueled not by new spikes but by a steady, continued slow-burn of infections in states with large populations. Even California and Texas &mdash; both states where cases had dropped off significantly in late summer &mdash; each continue to post more than <a href=""https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#cases_casesinlast7days"">20,000 cases a week</a>. </p>
<p>Hotez says models <a href=""https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/10/16/924240204/how-bad-will-coronavirus-be-this-winter-model-projects-170-000-more-u-s-deaths"">forecasting upward of 170,000 deaths</a> in about the next four months &mdash; and Dr. Anthony Fauci's <a href=""https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/07/01/886299190/it-does-not-have-to-be-100-000-cases-a-day-fauci-urges-u-s-to-follow-guidelines"">warnings</a> that the U.S. could eventually surpass 100,000 cases a day &mdash; may come to pass, given the current trajectory of the pandemic. </p>
<p><em>""</em>I think that's very real, and especially if we don't have any kind of national containment strategy,"" Hotez says. <em>""</em>The expectation is that cases will also accelerate across the country.""</p>
<p>Increasingly, the virus is sweeping through rural communities that had been spared earlier in the pandemic. </p>
<p>""We've really switched to the infections emerging in the last strongholds, which are rural areas of Iowa,"" says <a href=""https://www.public-health.uiowa.edu/people/christine-petersen/"">Dr. Christine Petersen</a> at the University of Iowa. ""This is a kind of a pattern that's consistent across at least the Midwest.""</p>
<p>Though many communities are eager to open up businesses and social events, they lack the tools to do so safely, says Adalja. </p>
<p>""The biggest issue is still the fact that many of these states don't have the capacity to test, trace and isolate,"" Adalja says, referring to the proven public health strategy that helps box in new infections before they can spread. </p>
<p>""It's not necessarily about reopening,"" Adalja says. ""It's about reopening with a plan and the public health infrastructure that's going to be able to absorb the inevitable number of cases that you get.""   </p> Copyright 2020 NPR.

With the flu season looming, the rate of new cases in the U.S. and other countries is rising at rates not seen in months.</p>
<p>The disease has killed more than 1.1 million people, including nearly 220,000 in the U.S., which remains the world's worst-hit country despite having less than 5% of the global population.</p>
<p>A worrying rise in new cases has triggered new shutdowns across Europe, where France, Belgium and the Czech Republic are among the countries seeing a surge in cases. Many of the measures announced this month are local or partial closures, as officials try to avoid the national lockdowns that have wreaked economic havoc in 2020.</p>
<p>India has seen its rate of new cases fall in recent weeks, after a meteoric rise in August and September. More than 114,000 people there have died from COVID-19. </p>
<p>The U.S. once again has the <a href=""https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/new-cases"">highest new case rate</a> in the world. The seven-day daily average in the U.S. is nearing the 60,000 mark &mdash; the level the country maintained for weeks this past summer during an alarming surge.</p>

<p></p><address>Jon Hamilton | NPR</address><p>Medical research was an early casualty of the COVID-19 pandemic. </p>
<p>After cases began emerging worldwide, thousands of clinical trials unrelated to COVID-19 were paused or canceled amid fears that participants would be infected. But now, some researchers are finding ways to carry on in spite of the coronavirus.</p>
<p>""It's been a struggle of course,"" says <a href=""https://www.faculty.uci.edu/profile.cfm?faculty_id=6201"">Joshua Grill</a>, who directs the Institute for Memory Impairments and Neurological Disorders at the University of California, Irvine. ""But I think there's an imperative for us to find ways to move forward.""</p>
<p>Grill got a close-up view of the challenge in July, when COVID-19 cases were spiking nationwide just as he was trying to launch a study.</p>
<p>UC Irvine and dozens of other research centers had just begun enrolling participants in the <a href=""https://www.aheadstudy.org/"">AHEAD study</a>, a global effort that will test whether an investigational drug can slow down the earliest brain changes associated with Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>Finding individuals willing and able to sign up for this sort of research is difficult even without a pandemic, says Grill who also co-directs recruitment for the <a href=""https://www.nia.nih.gov/research/dn/alzheimers-clinical-trials-consortium-actc"">Alzheimer's Clinical Trial Consortium</a>, funded by the National Institute on Aging.</p>
<p>""We're asking people do a lot, including enroll in long studies that require numerous visits,"" he says, ""and in the AHEAD study, taking an investigational drug or placebo that's injected into a vein.""</p>
<p>Participants will receive either a placebo or a drug called BAN2401, which is meant to reduce levels of amyloid, a toxic protein associated with Alzheimer's. People in the study will also have PET scans of their brains to measure changes in amyloid and another toxic protein called tau.</p>
<p>Researchers know that for participants, every visit represents a potential exposure to the coronavirus. That's a sobering thought, given that some of those participants are as old as 80, Grill says. </p>
<p>So, like most research centers, UC Irvine has implemented a long list of <a href=""https://www.fda.gov/media/137496/download"">safety measures</a>. </p>
<p>Medical staff get daily screenings, patient visits are spaced out to avoid overlaps, exam rooms get extra cleaning, and personal protective equipment is the norm.</p>
<p>""We think we can minimize that risk to an extent necessary to move these studies forward, and that it's urgent that we do that,"" Grill says.</p>
<p>So far, Grill says, the measures appear to be working. Participants aren't getting infected and they are signing up.</p>
<p>""I've just been completely, totally inspired by the people enrolled in these studies, the majority of whom really want us to push ahead,"" he says.</p>
<p>Of course, some people have dropped out, saying the risk of infection is too great.  Also, recruiting has become very difficult in African-American and Latino communities, which have been especially hard hit by COVID-19, Grill says.</p>
<p>The fear in these communities became obvious early in the pandemic, says <a href=""https://www.rushu.rush.edu/faculty/crystal-glover-phd"">Crystal Glover</a>, a social psychologist who is in charge of community outreach at the Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center in Chicago. </p>
<p>""They had heard about COVID, they heard that we had patients there that were being treated for COVID,"" she says. ""And they indicated that they did not want to come to our institution.""</p>
<p>So Glover has been focusing on solutions, and advising recruitment efforts at other centers, including those involved in the AHEAD study. </p>
<p>Her message is straightforward: ""If we are looking to enroll folks now, we need to reach back out to the communities in which we already have relationships,"" she says.</p>
<p>For Rush, that has meant offering support and services to minority communities before asking for participation in research.</p>
<p>""We've had town halls, we've had [personal protective equipment] drives, we've had webinars on the proper use of PPE, food delivery, food drives,"" Glover says.</p>
<p>When fears are high, she says, researchers also need to explain why a particular study matters to a specific community.</p>
<p>""We know that these chronic diseases of aging are really impacting Blacks and Latinos at higher rates than non-Latino whites,"" Glover says. ""I lead in with that.""</p>
<p>Then she goes on to explain ""why this is relevant, it's not only relevant to you but also to your family and future generations.""</p>
<p>Rush is also trying some new tactics to reach minority communities during the pandemic.  One involves staging health and wellness events at laundromats that are owned by women and people of color and that serve essential workers. </p>
<p>Glover says people who show up can wash their clothes for free in a place where social distancing is strictly maintained. And they may also learn a bit about research on Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>""We have that information for them at the laundromat,"" She says. ""But they get to wash their clothes and stay safe during COVID 19.""</p>
<p>Efforts like that are crucial right now, Grill says. </p>
